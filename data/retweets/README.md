## Retweet information

The [retweet-counts.csv](retweet-counts.csv) file is a comma-separated 
table with three columns:

1. Screen name of retweeting account
2. Screen name of retweeted account
3. Number of retweets

Notes:

* These counts include all known retweets, regardless of the deletion status of either the tweet or the retweet.
* Please see [the top-level README](https://github.com/travisbrown/deleted-tweets) for details about how this account information was collected.
* In particular note that the numbers here only track our subset of Twitter pages from the Wayback Machine and are not complete for many accounts.
